# A Primer on Binary Logistic Regression (in R)

This repository contains the statistical source code for the logistic regression primer by Jenine Harris. If you are new to R, follow the instructions below to install the appropriate software and download the source code.

### Getting Started in R

R is a statistical software that is <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">free, open-source, and can run on most operating systems</a>. This means that anyone in the world with access to a computer and the internet can use it and anyone in the world can contribute to the development of new tools in R. 

R can do everything that paid statistical software like SPSS and SAS can do, and often more! <a href = "http://r4stats.com/2019/05/28/data-science-jobs-report-2019-python-way-up-tensorflow-growing-rapidly-r-use-double-sas/">Analysis of data on job openings and other metrics</a> shows that R is increasingly included as a desired or required skill, often surpassing traditional closed source software like SPSS and SAS. R is particularly great for **data management** and developing amazing **data visualizations**.

### Installing R and R Studio

R is the software and R Studio is the IDE (Interactive Development Environment) that makes R easier to use. Install R **before** you install R Studio because R Studio will look for R during installation.

First, download and install R:

<ul>
  <li> Click the <b>download R</b> link on the <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">R Project for Statistical Computing</a> website
  <li> Choose one of the options from the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> list (it doesn't matter which one!)
  <li> Click on the download that is appopropriate for your operating system, Linux, Mac, or Windows; if you are not given this option, go back to the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> and try a different one
  <li> Find the link for <b>install R for the first time</b> and click on it
  <li> Click on the the <b>Download R</b> link on the page that opens
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R 
</ul>
